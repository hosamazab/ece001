<h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
    Machines don’t require frequent breaks and refreshments as like human beings.<br>
    That can be programmed to work for long hours and can able to perform the job continuously without getting bored or distracted or even tired.<br>
    Using machines, we can also expect the same kind of results irrespective of timings, season and etc., those we can’t expect from human beings.<br>
    </p>
 <h2>Digital Assistance</h2>
    <p>
        Highly advanced organizations already implemented machines on behalf of humans to interact with their customers by using ‘avatars’.<br> 
        It is the digital assistants or replicas which will help to reduce the need for human resources.<br>
        For AI Machines, emotions only can be identified in the way of rational thinking.<br>
        Robots can’t identify the sentimental factor of the user.<br>
         It actually programmed for only think logically and take the right program decisions based on the existing experience taught to the machine.<br>
        Emotions can’t be identifying by the machines that may be dissatisfying the customer.<br>
         In that case, we need human intervention. This lagging tries to rule out for machine intelligence. But still, it helps in other aspects.<br>

    <h2> Medical Applications</h2>
        <p>
        One of the great advantages of Artificial Intelligence is utilized in the field of medicine.<br>
         We can identify the numerous numbers of medical applications which rely on AI.<br>
        Doctors/Physician assesses the patient’s health-related data and intimates the risk factors to the customers via the health care devices with the help of artificial machine intelligence.<br>
        It helps the patient to know about the side effects of different medicines and also behaves as personal digital care. <br>
        Artificial surgery simulator is the great innovation part of the AI.<br>
         The efficiency of that always prefers to utilize that simulator by the Professionals for the treatment.<br>
        Currently, we have huge software to detect as well as monitor the neurological disorders. <br>
        It can simulate the functionality of the human brain.<br>
        Robotics is used often in the treatment for mentally sick patients to come out from their depression also make them remain active in the real world.<br>
        The current medical industry has the popular application of artificial intelligence is Radiosurgery. <br>
        It helps us to operate the tumors without damaging the unaffected surrounding tissues.<br>
